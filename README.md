# ImageProcessing_ColourQR
Creation of an image processing program to read colour QR codes. Completed as part of a Masters in Data Science

# Introduction 
The program, ‘ColourQR’, was developed with the goal of correctly identifying the order of coloured squares in a 4x4 matrix. Thirty images with varying levels of noise, colour saturation, rotation, or distortion, were processed by specific functions to correct the images and identify the colours of the squares. The code was written in Python using the PyCharm IDE and the software utilises the OpenCV, CV2 library. All functions were grouped under the class, ColourQR.
